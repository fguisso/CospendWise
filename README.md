## 🌟 About This Project

Hey there! 👋 This is a special project with a unique story. I'm a programmer who had zero knowledge about Android, [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), or [Dart](https://dart.dev) when starting this. I didn't even understand the [Cospend API](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/wiki/API-documentation)! What I did know was that I wanted something as beautiful as Splitwise (where I came from) but integrated with [Nextcloud Cospend](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cospend).

I'm now a heavy Cospend user, but I found the [MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) mobile app didn't quite match what I was looking for in terms of UI/UX. So, with the help of [Claude AI](https://anthropic.com/claude), I created this project to experiment with a more modern interface.

### 🤝 Looking for Contributors!

If you're experienced with Flutter/Dart and share the same interest in making Cospend more beautiful, I'd love to hand this project over to you or a community to lead! Thanks to [MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) and [Cospend](https://github.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc) for providing inspiration both in terms of usability and implementations.
